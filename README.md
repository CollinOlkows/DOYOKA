# DOYOKA 2

A python based command and control server and agent. Do You Know Amitesh?

NOTE: This was made for educational purposes and for self monitoring machines I own, please only use this on machines you have permission to access

## Installation

Install and run the corresponding files, bot for client, server for server

Note: When setting up the server, ensure you run the add admin python file to create an admin account.
Additionally, change the config "password" to the password for your admin account (Currently it is set to 'password' which is a 
publicly visible in the readme as its meant to be changed)

Additionally, you should be updating the config to reflect the proper ports and IP's for the socket server (You likely will only need to update
the socket server URL to reflect the servers machine IP)

You should be in the repo root folder (same as the config) when running the server and bot, otherwise the config file may be out of scope for the other files and cause issues. An exable of running the file could be "python ./Server/server.py". Future updates will include a simple run script

## Current Features

Ability to remotely monitor a machines screen over screenshare

Access to commands and command output

Support for multiple machines to be connected

Account creation with login support
